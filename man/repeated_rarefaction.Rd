\usage{
repeated_rarefaction(
  input,
  repeats = 50,
  threshold = 250,
  colorb = "sample_id",
  group = "sample_id",
  cloud = TRUE,
  ellipse = FALSE,
  cores = 2,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A \code{phyloseq} object.}

\item{repeats}{An integer. The number of times to repeat rarefaction. A value of 1 means no repeats. Default = 50.}

\item{threshold}{An integer. The threshold value to use for rarefaction. Default = 250.}

\item{colorb}{A string. Column name in the \code{sample_data()} bundled with the
supplied \code{phyloseq} object, used to color sample points.}

\item{group}{A string. Column name in \code{sample_data()} used for grouping the samples.
The parameter is also used to calculate an ellipse around the points.
The supplied value should coincide with the \code{group} when using the function
\code{threshold_testing}, since it is on this parameter that also the clustering
performance index is calculated.}

\item{cloud}{A boolean. If \code{TRUE}, all repeated data points are shown.
Otherwise, only the median points of each sample repetitions cloud are plotted.
Default = FALSE.}

\item{ellipse}{A boolean. If \code{TRUE}, confidence ellipses around samples are
from the same group are drawn. Default = TRUE.}

\item{cores}{An integer. Number of cores to use for parallel processing. Default = 2.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the function.}
}
\value{
A list containing (While also showing the plot directly):
\itemize{
\item \code{repeats}: Number of repeats.
\item \code{df_consensus_coordinates}: Median ordination positions.
\item \code{df_all}: All ordination positions.
\item \code{plot}: a \code{ggplot} object.
}
}
\description{
This function performs repeated rarefaction on a phyloseq object,
computes ordination, and generates a PCoA-based visualization.
The same procedure is used from \code{threshold_testing} function when testing
a range of thresholds.
