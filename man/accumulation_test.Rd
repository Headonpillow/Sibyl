\title{Accumulation Curve Analysis}
\usage{
accumulation_test(input, step = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A \code{phyloseq} object.}

\item{step}{A numeric value. The step size for drawing the accumulation curve.
Default = 5.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{accumulation_plot}: A ggplot2 object with all sites faceted.
\item \code{threshold_density}: A ggplot2 density/histogram plot of the 75\% ACE thresholds.
\item \code{individual_plots}: A list of ggplot2 objects, one per site.
}
}
\description{
This function generates accumulation (rarefaction) curves for each sample in
a given \code{phyloseq} object, fits a general accumulation model using the Abundance
Coverage Estimator (ACE) as an asymptote, and identifies the sequencing
depth at which 75\% of the ACE value is reached. It also produces a density
plot showing the distribution of these 75\% completion thresholds.
